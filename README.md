This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline to predict student placement outcomes based on features like CGPA and resume scores using the Perceptron algorithm.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset (placement.csv) includes:

cgpa: Student's CGPA

resume_score: Score based on resume quality

placed: Binary label indicating placement status

ðŸ§  Model
The model used is the Perceptron from sklearn.linear_model, a basic binary classifier suited for linearly separable data.

ðŸ“Š Visualization
The dataset is visualized using Seaborn to understand feature relationships and class separability.

ðŸ“ˆ Output
Scatter plots of CGPA vs Resume Score, color-coded by placement.
